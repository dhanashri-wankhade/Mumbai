				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
					Human habitation of Mumbai/Bombay existed since the Stone Age,
					the Kolis and Aagri were the earliest known settlers of the 
					islands. The Maurya Empire gained control of the islands during 
					the 3rd century BCE and transformed it into a centre of 
					Hindu-Buddhist culture and religion. Later, between the 2nd 
					century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the 
					control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, 
					Abhiras, Vakatakas, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and 
					Rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the Silharas from 810 to 1260.
