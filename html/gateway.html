				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					After its construction the gateway was used as a symbolic 
                    ceremonial entrance to India for important colonial personnel. 
                    The gateway is also the monument from where the last British 
                    troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It 
                    is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj 
                    Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. 
                   

				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
                    Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, 
                    and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is 
                    also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and 
                    photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for 
                    the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah 
                    celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There 
                    are five jetties located at the gateway, of which two are used for 
                    commercial ferry operations.

				<h3>Design And Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					In February 2019, Seagate Technology and CyArk embarked on a 
                    mission to digitally record and preserve the gateway, by 
                    digital scanning and archiving of the monument.[20] The images 
                    and data collected will be used to make photo-real three 
                    dimensional models.[38] This is a part of CyArk's international 
                    programme for digitally preserving heritage monuments.[20] It 
                    involves aerial surveys conducted with terrestrial laser scanning 
                    (LiDAR), drones, and photogrammetry exercises.[39] The drawings 
                    and three-dimensional models will inform any future reconstruction 
                    works.

				<h3>Tourism</h3>
				<p>
					The gateway is amongst the prime tourist attractions in Mumbai. 
                    The gateway is a protected monument in Maharashtra under the 
                    aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).[64] It is a 
                    regular gathering place for locals, street vendors, and 
                    photographers.In 2012, the Maharashtra Tourism Development 
                    Corporation moved the Elephanta Festival of Music and Dance from 
                    its original location at Elephanta Caves — where it had been 
                    celebrated for 23 years — to the gateway, due to the increased 
                    capacity offered by the venue.[65] The gateway can host 2,000 to 
                    2,500 people, whereas Elephanta Caves could host only 700 to 800.[
