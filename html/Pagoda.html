				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					The Global Vipassana Pagoda is a Meditation dome hall with a 
                    capacity to seat around 8,000 Vipassana meditators (the largest 
                    such meditation hall in the world) near Gorai, north-west of 
                    Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The pagoda was inaugurated by Pratibha 
                    Patil, then President of India, on 8 February 2009.[1] It is built 
                    on donated land on a peninsula between Gorai creek and the Arabian 
                    Sea. The pagoda is to serve as a monument of peace and harmony. 
                    The Global Vipassana Pagoda has been built out of gratitude to 
                    Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899 - 1971), Vipassana teacher and the first 
                    Accountant-General of Independent Burma, who was instrumental in 
                    Vipassana returning to India, the country of its origin.
                   

				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
                    Built entirely through voluntary donations, the purpose of the Global 
                    Vipassana Pagoda is to: 1) share information about Vipassana, and 2) 
                    spread information on Gotama the Buddha and his teachings.

				<h3>Timeline</h3>
				<p>
					Planning for the construction of the Global Vipassana Pagoda began 
                    in 1997, while actual building work started in 2000. The pagoda 
                    consists of three sub-domes. The first and largest dome was completed 
                    in October 2006 when bone relics of Gautam Buddha were enshrined in 
                    the central locking stone of the dome on 29 October 2006, making it 
                    the world's largest structure containing relics of the Buddha. The 
                    relics were originally found in the stupa at Bhattiprolu, Guntur 
                    district, Andhra Pradesh, South India.[9] They have been donated by 
                    the Mahabodhi Society of India and the prime minister of Sri Lanka 
                    to be kept at the Global Vipassana Pagoda.[10][11] The second and 
                    third domes sit atop the first dome. Construction of the third dome 
                    was structurally completed on 21 November 2008.
