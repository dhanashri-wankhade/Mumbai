				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					The Elephanta Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, mostly in 
                    high relief, that show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist ideas 
                    and iconography.[5][8][9] The caves are hewn from solid basalt 
                    rock. Except for a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced 
                    and damaged.[10] The main temple's orientation as well as the 
                    relative location of other temples are placed in a mandala pattern. 
                    The carvings narrate Hindu mythologies, with the large monolithic 
                    20 feet (6.1 m) Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (
                    Lord of dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yoga) being the most 
                    celebrated.

                    These date to between the 5th and 9th centuries, and scholars 
                    attribute them to various Hindu dynasties.[1][2] They are most 
                    commonly placed between the 5th and 7th centuries. Many scholars 
                    consider them to have been completed by about 550 CE.

				<h3>Geography</h3>
				<p>
					Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri, is about 10 km (6.2 mi) east of the 
                    Gateway of India in the Mumbai Harbour and less than 2 km (1.2 mi) 
                    west of Jawaharlal Nehru Port. The island covers about 10 km2 (3.9 
                    sq mi) at high tide and about 16 km2 (6.2 sq mi) at low tide. 
                    Gharapuri is a small village on the south side of the island.
                    The Elephanta Caves is connected by ferry services from the Gateway 
                    of India, Mumbai between 9AM and 2PM daily, except Monday when the 
                    Caves are closed. Mumbai has a major domestic and international 
                    airport, as well as is connected to the Indian Railways

				<br />
				<h3>Sadasiv: Trimurti</h3>
				<p>
					The Trimurti is considered a masterpiece and the most important 
                    sculpture in the caves.[27] It is carved in relief on the south 
                    wall of the cave facing the north entrance, along the northâ€“south 
                    axis. It is also known as Sadashiva and Maheshmurti. The image, 6 m 
                    (20 ft) in height, depicts a three-headed Shiva, representing 
                    Panchamukha Shiva.
